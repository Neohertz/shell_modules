My personal zsh module pack.

## Install

1. Clone the Repo.
2. Move the needed modules to a folder of your choice.
3. Use `chmod u+r+x (modulename)` on each file.
4. Add references to each folder to your path.

## Commands

### New

The new script helps me make projects quickly. It currently supports lua/rbxts + rojo setups.

### Repex

**Rep**lace **Ex**tension

Repex will replace all file extensions within the directory with a new one.
